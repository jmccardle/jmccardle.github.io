# Roguelike Development

## McRogueFace

I'm the developer of McRogueFace, a game engine based on SFML that ships an entire Python interpreter.

Goals:
* Rapidly make games that are essentially "move tiny pictures around a rectangular grid"
* Get just a *little* more graphical pizzazz than ASCII or text mode games.
* Write games entirely in Python, but frames without game logic are rendered entirely by C++ without calling the interpreter.
* Target audience: brand-new programmers, game jam developers, and AI researchers interested in environments for agents.

## TCOD Tutorial

* [Updated tutorial code](https://github.com/jmccardle/tcod_tutorial_v2)
* [Updated tutorial lessons](/tutorials/tcod)

I've updated the code for the [TCOD python tutorial](https://github.com/jmccardle/tcod_tutorial_v2) to support TCOD 19.3, as well as applying the refactoring throughout the earlier chapters [as TStand90 himself mused](https://tylerstandridge.com/posts/issues-with-the-roguelike-tutorial/#those-sections).

The TCOD tutorials corresponding to the code I forked are still up at [rogueliketutorials.com](https://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/v2/). The source for that website is available [in TStand90/roguelike-tutorials-website](https://github.com/TStand90/roguelike-tutorials-website).

I'd like to personally thank Tyler Standridge (TStand90) and Kyle Benesch (HexDecimal) for writing the original tutorial and licensing it openly for their foundation to be built upon.
